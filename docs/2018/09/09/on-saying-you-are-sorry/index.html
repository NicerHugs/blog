		<p>an incredibly long time ago (about 10 years) i coined language to distinguish between the uses of the words “i’m sorry”: “empathetic sorry” and “apology sorry”. <a href="http://freefallinboston.blogspot.com/2009/02/empathetic-sorry-not-apology-sorry.html">i have written about saying you’re sorry before</a>, but that was 9 years ago and guess what? i’m not the same person i was back then.</p>

<p>i have, in the interim, written rules for relationships which i periodically consult (usually when relationships are presenting challenges), to test or confirm that my behavior matches my stated values. yes. i really do that. no, i don’t always follow the rules. but i try. and when i falter, i try again.</p>

<p>sometimes, this checking behavior results in a re-evaluation of my values. more often, tho, it is a helpful guide for me to behave more skillfully within the values i have already identified.</p>

<p>months ago i <a href="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2018/02/16/on-taking-responsibility-for-yourself/">acknowledged that i was stuck thinking about apologies</a>, however vaguely, and i haven’t made moves on it since. i find myself making apologies (a third kind, the excuse kind) for why writing about saying you’re sorry is too hard to do, or doesn’t seem to fit with my values exactly. and yet on the list it remains. of importance it is. think about it i must.</p>

<p>human beings are challenging creatures, to say the least. our minds obsess over thoughts whether those thoughts are productive or helpful, seek patterns where none exist, reject acceptance of things outside their current frame or scope of understanding, and (need i go on?) find incredibly creative and deceptive ways for us to believe whatever it is that we <em>want</em> to believe.</p>

<p>today, i said to a friend, “honesty is one of my greatest values. i would say it is the greatest, but that isn’t true, i know i value tact above honesty.” which is hard for me to admit, and something i’ve learned only through self observation. on some level i <em>want</em> honesty to be my greatest value, because when i acquiesce from honesty to tact, i question my own authenticity. and while we’re talking about values… let’s move tact or honesty a mile below authenticity, which is at the core of everything i want in my life, forever.</p>

<p>refusing to write about the apology rule (which, for the record, states, “If you hurt someone, say you’re sorry, and mean it.”), is basically me putting honesty above tact, and hiding behind a shroud of “authenticity.” because what does it mean to hurt someone, when really i believe we should take responsibility for our own needs? is it even <em>possible</em> to hurt someone?</p>

<p>but what kind of feeling nazi am i to say that feelings of pain are only valid if they source from an enlightened sense of our own minds’ inappropriate expectation setting? what kind of compassion and empathy does it show to say “i didn’t hurt you, you hurt you”? i mean, let me just simplify this even further and say how dare i even begin to suggest that a <em>feeling</em> can be <em>valid</em>. i’m not enlightened, for fuck’s sake. you aren’t either. none of us are. get over it.</p>

<p>my point, here, my 10 years later point in this rambling, is that feelings are real. that feeling hurt, whether you blame someone/thing outside yourself or acknowledge the mind’s culpability and say (as i often do), “only i can hurt myself,” is unpleasant. we owe it to those we love and care about, and everyone they love and care about, and by extension everyone in the whole damn world, to acknowledge that discomfort. it doesn’t matter whether we are being empathetic, or whether we are admitting guilt. it doesn’t matter whether we believe the pain someone else feels is “valid”. it matters that we offer our presence to another human’s experience. that we share in that experience of pain. that we stand together with them in their pain with the strength of character to say “i’m sorry”.</p>

<p>if you are suffering right now, know that you are not alone. we all suffer. that does not minimize your experience of pain. it does not limit your uniqueness or inform what retribution you deserve. it means only that you are not alone. that the pain you feel is real, and valid, no matter what caused it, no matter how bad it hurts, and no matter who tells you otherwise. you deserve to be free of that suffering. you deserve to feel peace. whether an apology is an “empathetic sorry” or an “apology sorry” does not matter. what matters is this. suffering is engrained in the human experience. not a single one of us is alone.</p>
