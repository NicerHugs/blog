		<p>i recently joined <a href="http://simbi.com">simbi.com</a> on whim and a recommendation from a friend. it’s a sharing economy (plus barter, alternative currency) site for offering and finding mostly services. i’m pretty skeptical, about the utility of it, but i don’t think it hurts to give it a shot.</p>

<p>relatedly, after i told erik i wouldn’t be exercising much before coming to climb with him because i’d be storing up my joint pain for one big push when i got there, he said, ‘well, you can at least do a bunch of sit-ups’ and i realized… yeah, that’s true. but i probably won’t. not because i don’t want to, but honestly i’ve false started like 5 times in the last as many months in effort to start up an exercise routine again (other than the biking to work bit which i haven’t done lately on account of health), and i just have lost faith in my actual ability to follow through</p>

<p>enter the desire for an ‘accountability buddy’ to get mad at me if i do not actually do the exercises i set out to do. kind of like inna’s and my flossing game (whereby we tell the other when we’ve flossed, and if the other has not yet flossed, they immediately lose the game). and this is where simbi is coming into the story</p>

<p>i posted that i wanted someone to help be an accountability buddy for me with fitness and several ladies have responded. i’m putting together a group of us, and we’ll all communicate through texting (or hangouts probably) to keep each other on track. a total social experiment to see if we can build a sense of community through random internet connection.</p>

<p>well, not totally random, because there is presumably a certain type of people who are interested in a sharing economy based app, and who all think they need someone else to help keep them on track with exercise. but otherwise… totally random…</p>

<p>aiming to track success or failure of said project much like i tracked progress of dietary experiments 8 years ago.</p>
