					<p>an incredibly long time ago (about 10 years) i coined language to distinguish between the uses of the words “i’m sorry”: “empathetic sorry” and “apology sorry”. <a href="http://freefallinboston.blogspot.com/2009/02/empathetic-sorry-not-apology-sorry.html">i have written about saying you’re sorry before</a>, but that was 9 years ago and guess what? i’m not the same person i was back then.</p>

					<p>i’ve spent the last month or so thinking about the next rule and not wanting to write about it, because i’ve found myself repeatedly adding caveats to it; it occurs to me that the rules have a hierarchy, and that really the first rule ought to be ‘Take responsibility for your own needs’.</p>

					<p>some additional thoughts about rule #1, ask for what you want and be ok with not getting it. suffice to say that not everyone follows this rule. not everyone puts effort into creating real, honest communication, and even when you work at it sometimes you’ll falter.</p>

					<p>about a year and a half ago i shared my <a href="http://archive.nicerhugs.com/2016/05/rules-for-interacting-with-people.html">rules for interacting with people</a> which i’ve been thinking about again, lately. i’m pretty much always impressed with former me, and wonder why present me isn’t all that much together like she was.</p>

					<p>I have heard about how the best teacher is someone who is just one step ahead of you. I think this is true of the stumble upon mentor, but not true of a professional educator. And I think promoting this idea does us a disservice by implying that mentorship is not itself a skill that can be learned, improved upon, and honed over time. With growth mindset, learning to teach is just as important as learning to learn. Those of us who find we forget what we know, or how to communicate with folks at significantly more beginner level than ourselves should learn to see this as a growth opportunity.</p>
