&lt;p&gt;i have, in the interim, written rules for relationships which i periodically consult (usually when relationships are presenting challenges), to test or confirm that my behavior matches my stated values. yes. i really do that. no, i don’t always follow the rules. but i try. and when i falter, i try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sometimes, this checking behavior results in a re-evaluation of my values. more often, tho, it is a helpful guide for me to behave more skillfully within the values i have already identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;months ago i &lt;a href=&quot;http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2018/02/16/on-taking-responsibility-for-yourself/&quot;&gt;acknowledged that i was stuck thinking about apologies&lt;/a&gt;, however vaguely, and i haven’t made moves on it since. i find myself making apologies (a third kind, the excuse kind) for why writing about saying you’re sorry is too hard to do, or doesn’t seem to fit with my values exactly. and yet on the list it remains. of importance it is. think about it i must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;human beings are challenging creatures, to say the least. our minds obsess over thoughts whether those thoughts are productive or helpful, seek patterns where none exist, reject acceptance of things outside their current frame or scope of understanding, and (need i go on?) find incredibly creative and deceptive ways for us to believe whatever it is that we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today, i said to a friend, “honesty is one of my greatest values. i would say it is the greatest, but that isn’t true, i know i value tact above honesty.” which is hard for me to admit, and something i’ve learned only through self observation. on some level i &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; honesty to be my greatest value, because when i acquiesce from honesty to tact, i question my own authenticity. and while we’re talking about values… let’s move tact or honesty a mile below authenticity, which is at the core of everything i want in my life, forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;refusing to write about the apology rule (which, for the record, states, “If you hurt someone, say you’re sorry, and mean it.”), is basically me putting honesty above tact, and hiding behind a shroud of “authenticity.” because what does it mean to hurt someone, when really i believe we should take responsibility for our own needs? is it even &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to hurt someone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but what kind of feeling nazi am i to say that feelings of pain are only valid if they source from an enlightened sense of our own minds’ inappropriate expectation setting? what kind of compassion and empathy does it show to say “i didn’t hurt you, you hurt you”? i mean, let me just simplify this even further and say how dare i even begin to suggest that a &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; can be &lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;. i’m not enlightened, for fuck’s sake. you aren’t either. none of us are. get over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my point, here, my 10 years later point in this rambling, is that feelings are real. that feeling hurt, whether you blame someone/thing outside yourself or acknowledge the mind’s culpability and say (as i often do), “only i can hurt myself,” is unpleasant. we owe it to those we love and care about, and everyone they love and care about, and by extension everyone in the whole damn world, to acknowledge that discomfort. it doesn’t matter whether we are being empathetic, or whether we are admitting guilt. it doesn’t matter whether we believe the pain someone else feels is “valid”. it matters that we offer our presence to another human’s experience. that we share in that experience of pain. that we stand together with them in their pain with the strength of character to say “i’m sorry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you are suffering right now, know that you are not alone. we all suffer. that does not minimize your experience of pain. it does not limit your uniqueness or inform what retribution you deserve. it means only that you are not alone. that the pain you feel is real, and valid, no matter what caused it, no matter how bad it hurts, and no matter who tells you otherwise. you deserve to be free of that suffering. you deserve to feel peace. whether an apology is an “empathetic sorry” or an “apology sorry” does not matter. what matters is this. suffering is engrained in the human experience. not a single one of us is alone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">an incredibly long time ago (about 10 years) i coined language to distinguish between the uses of the words “i’m sorry”: “empathetic sorry” and “apology sorry”. i have written about saying you’re sorry before, but that was 9 years ago and guess what? i’m not the same person i was back then.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Taking Responsibility For Yourself</title><link href="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2018/02/16/on-taking-responsibility-for-yourself/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Taking Responsibility For Yourself" /><published>2018-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2018/02/16/on-taking-responsibility-for-yourself</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2018/02/16/on-taking-responsibility-for-yourself/">&lt;p&gt;i’ve spent the last month or so thinking about the next rule and not wanting to write about it, because i’ve found myself repeatedly adding caveats to it; it occurs to me that the rules have a hierarchy, and that really the first rule ought to be ‘Take responsibility for your own needs’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even before that rule, tho, i’ve set an implicit expectation that we can know the difference between what we want and what we need. and it follows that we cannot ask for what we want if we haven’t yet made that distinction, and of course our needs must come before our wants in our own self advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;taking responsibility for your own needs is, well, hard. but it doesn’t mean doing it all on your own. on the contrary, taking responsibility for your needs means advocating for them, and that often involves asking others to help you meet them. sometimes that means admitting you can’t do something on your own, or that you don’t understand something you think you should. often it means putting yourself out there, and being vulnerable. always it means knowing yourself well enough to know what you really need so that you can even begin to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it means, i think most importantly, when someone communicates with their words or demonstrates with their actions an inability to help you meet your needs, you do not hold them responsible for that need not being met. you can, of course, hold them responsible for failing to follow through on something if they said they would do a thing they didn’t, but at the end of the day your needs are yours and yours alone. so instead of shirking your responsibility in your disappointment, you must continue to take responsibility for your own needs by finding another way for that need to be met.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">i’ve spent the last month or so thinking about the next rule and not wanting to write about it, because i’ve found myself repeatedly adding caveats to it; it occurs to me that the rules have a hierarchy, and that really the first rule ought to be ‘Take responsibility for your own needs’.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Being Ok With Not Getting What You Want</title><link href="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/12/08/on-being-ok-with-not-getting-what-you-want/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Being Ok With Not Getting What You Want" /><published>2017-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-12-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/12/08/on-being-ok-with-not-getting-what-you-want</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/12/08/on-being-ok-with-not-getting-what-you-want/">&lt;p&gt;some additional thoughts about rule #1, ask for what you want and be ok with not getting it. suffice to say that not everyone follows this rule. not everyone puts effort into creating real, honest communication, and even when you work at it sometimes you’ll falter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, i want to reiterate that is is &lt;em&gt;difficult&lt;/em&gt; to ask for what you want. period. not everyone is comfortable with this level of communication, and embracing that discomfort is a brave and scary thing to do. it’s entirely possible that asking for what you want will cause you to confront awkwardness, anger, rejection - sometimes even the death of a friendship or relationship. despite this, i still hold firm to its importance and march ever forward. if someone else doesn’t want full on scary honesty, that’s ok. it’s everyone’s right to make (or not make, and thereby make) the decisions that guide their life, including how and to whom they communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it’s inevitable of asking for what you want directly that you can (and will) be confronted with others’ reactions (or lack thereof). people might fear causing pain, might not trust that you’ll accept their decline, might be scared of being honest themselves, or have any number of other reasons for not responding with their best self. your requests may be returned with laughter, anger, direct rejection, or even nothing at all. navigating responses to honesty requires as much presence and self awareness as asking for what you want in the first place. making it a part of the rule that you must be “ok” with rejection makes this rule &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; hard to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is no external reward for behaving in this way. there is no guarantee that others will see your honesty as good, or pat you on the back for your ability to accept rejection with apparent ease. honesty is no more likely to get you what you want than the accidental manipulation i spoke of before, and in fact it will cause you to directly confront rejection far more frequently if you truly put it into practice. the expectation that we even get a response at all may never be met, let alone that the response is the one we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;despite all these apparent negatives, i really believe that this rule is the first and most foundational rule of good communication, and therefore good relationships. asking for what you want requires that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what you want, and that you are your authentic self when you present to others. the greater opportunities for intimacy this affords far outweigh the discomforts. over time the relationships that flourish with this standard of communication will prove themselves more valuable than the ones that crumble under fears of vulnerability. in short, if your friends can’t handle honesty, keep being honest until you find those who can - you’ll be better off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and while being rejected never feels good, facing rejection directly is an excellent teacher in humility. it’s a a great time to practice patience and compassion with yourself, get to know yourself better, and remember that we cannot control anything but our own behaviors. accepting that we do not always get what we want is a lifelong journey.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">some additional thoughts about rule #1, ask for what you want and be ok with not getting it. suffice to say that not everyone follows this rule. not everyone puts effort into creating real, honest communication, and even when you work at it sometimes you’ll falter.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Asking For What You Want</title><link href="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/11/28/on-asking-for-what-you-want/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Asking For What You Want" /><published>2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/11/28/on-asking-for-what-you-want</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/11/28/on-asking-for-what-you-want/">&lt;p&gt;about a year and a half ago i shared my &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.nicerhugs.com/2016/05/rules-for-interacting-with-people.html&quot;&gt;rules for interacting with people&lt;/a&gt; which i’ve been thinking about again, lately. i’m pretty much always impressed with former me, and wonder why present me isn’t all that much together like she was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’ve been hankering to explain them, so i’m just gon’ do it. one rule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;rule 1 (ask for what you want, and then be OK with not getting it) and rule 11 (request consent but don’t push for it) are pretty much the same, but i like rule 1 better, and my newer more enlightened self has stricken rule 11 from the list. #11 is basically a dumbed down, no challenge way of saying #1. and by that i mean, rule 1 is up front consent requesting without leaving room for accidental manipulative consent bypass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;accidental manipulative consent bypass? dear god, did i just create that horrible phrase? it sounds super gross but the reality is i think everyone engages in this, &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. in the long distance hiking community we call it yogi’ing - aka acting like yogi bear, aka stealing someone else’s pic-in-ic basket. the rules for yogi’ing are, you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; directly ask for what you want. so if you want someone to share their cheese with you, you must cleverly manipulate them into giving it to you, usually achieved by being a starving thru-hiker in the presence of an unsuspecting and super star-struck day-hiker meeting a bill bryson-esque adventurer irl for the first time. really you don’t have to say much. you just kind of tell them how you haven’t been to town in a few days and you’re starving and it’s so hot out and YES you’re really hiking the &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; trail, and voila, you’ve got cheese, and probably also an offer to sleep on a couch and get a warm shower!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now that, honestly, is a fun game. but it’s just that. a game. thru-hikers recognized it as such and oft have competitions to yogi the most goods out of  unsuspecting tourists at beautiful mountain vistas. games are fun when the participants know they’re playing and consent to playing (sorry, all you duped day-hikers; i hope you can accept an apology and the memories of smelly hiker funk in exchange for you unwitting participation and all that cheese). games are not so fun when they’re played with you against your will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yogi’ing differs from accidental manipulative consent bypass in that it is not accidental. it is, instead, very intentional in its manipulation. it’s fun to set out an explicit challenge to try to get something without ever asking for it, but it’s also kind of evil when it applies to things beyond cheese or grapes or a bottle of water. i’m really serious, tho, that we do this kind of thing without intending to with more frequency that we would like to admit. we &lt;em&gt;accidentally&lt;/em&gt; engage in manipulative behavior &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. it’s what complaining is. it’s what fishing for compliments is. it’s what “planting a seed” is. it’s why people read into your behavior or think you mean something you didn’t by a casual remark - they expect you’re doing this to them! it’s basically the comfortable way, and honestly, the socially acceptable way, of trying to get what we want, without having to explicitly ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;manipulative behavior is so common that i almost always give it the ‘accidental’ pass. most of our models for interacting with others suggest that directly asking for what you want is bad: it exposes your desires, it makes you vulnerable to rejection, it is too forward, it is rude, etc. that’s part of why asking for consent is so difficult. but you don’t have to ask for what you want if you can manipulate your way to someone else offering it first. it’s easy to just bypass asking for consent altogether and &lt;em&gt;still get what you want&lt;/em&gt; if you’re just being a normal human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don’t really stand for that. if i’m going to get or give consent, it expect it to be explicit. i’m certainly not perfect at that. that’s why i wrote a rule to remind myself of it. it takes a lot of courage and vulnerability to figure out what we really want, and then ask for it, directly, without pretense, without hinting and testing waters, without any manipulation at all. it takes a lot of courage and vulnerability to accept ‘no’ when the request isn’t met. but then, at least you know when you get what you want, that you’ve got it for real. that it was given in full knowledge, with full consent. that it was given on purpose, and not on accident.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">about a year and a half ago i shared my rules for interacting with people which i’ve been thinking about again, lately. i’m pretty much always impressed with former me, and wonder why present me isn’t all that much together like she was.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Mentoring</title><link href="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/09/12/on-mentoring/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Mentoring" /><published>2017-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/09/12/on-mentoring</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://comment.nicerhugs.com/2017/09/12/on-mentoring/">&lt;p&gt;I have heard about how the best teacher is someone who is just one step ahead of you. I think this is true of the stumble upon mentor, but not true of a professional educator. And I think promoting this idea does us a disservice by implying that mentorship is not itself a skill that can be learned, improved upon, and honed over time.

&lt;p&gt;Being a teacher is a nobel art.  We should all aspire to give back whatever we have been given, regardless of how far down that journey we have traveled. And this means humility. It means studying the art of teaching and respecting it as a craft of it’s own. It means self reflection, and effortful self improvement. It means shouldering the burden of improving our education rather than blaming the student who doesn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the person who is one step ahead of you may be your best mentor. But it is impossible that you will be the best mentor to those only one step behind you. It is a beautiful place to start. And it is just that. A start. You will be the best mentor to those for whom you do not give up. You will be the best mentor to those for whom you learn to teach better. You will be the best mentor to those for whom you give selflessly, humbly, and fully.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">I have heard about how the best teacher is someone who is just one step ahead of you.

&lt;p&gt;why do you dislike that food? why do you like this movie? why do you like this song? why do you like singing? why do you sleep so late in the day? why do you dislike the idea of an open relationship? why do you always use a fork and knife?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(that last one is an old joke. probably no one will get it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh, and then there’s this one: why am i always asking why? i notice a pattern in the questions: they are almost always about behavior or opinions that other people just seem to be comfortable taking for granted. 	sometimes there is an interesting story, an early traumatic experience with mayonnaise, for example, that comes out with a why about a dislike. and questions about opinions are fairly common - to clarify or gather more details about a preference, for example, is common as small and big talk; but typically once an opinion is expressed, the why’s begin to fall away. for the most part, it’s as if we assume that the root of opinion is some core fact, some deep infallible truth, never to be questioned, and never to be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don’t really buy into that approach. you prefer blonde hair? i want to know: &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;am i just curious? maybe. but i also entertain the possibility that the why i’m asking is about more than just curiosity. i think i probably have an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that’s not to make myself out to be a manipulator. but even innocent curiosity is an agenda on some level. i want to understand something, or at least understand it better. i want more information about a person or behavior. i want to know if my assumption about a behavior or opinion is correct. notice every single one of those curiosity inspired thoughts start with the same two words: &lt;strong&gt;i want&lt;/strong&gt;. i want more information. i want to understand. and those wants usually go one level deeper. i want to understand &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; i don’t feel the same way. i want more information &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; i like or dislike the person or behavior being discussed. i want verify my assumption &lt;em&gt;because…&lt;/em&gt; well, because i know i made an assumption, and i want to know if i was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all those wants are agendas. all those because’s point to a desired outcome. innocent tho my questions may feel to me, at their core lies a self serving human who wants to know and understand and master the domain of human experience. i am asking because i want something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and right now, i want to point this out: wanting something is not the same as &lt;em&gt;needing&lt;/em&gt; it. desiring an outcome is not the same as striving for it. i think it’s fine for me to ask why, even when that why is driven by a desire for an outcome, provided that outcome isn’t that i’m some egomaniac who wants to persuade everyone else to see what i see, the way i see it. really, i would be just as ok with being persuaded out of my (formed or forming) opinion or assumptions. and most of the time, it isn’t actually about persuading or being persuaded at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i want the most is to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt;. my experience is small. i am confined by the tangible boundaries of my body, and the intangible boundaries of my mind. the less i agree, the more i will ask why, but it isn’t that i want to change an opinion, it’s that i genuinely don’t understand, and i want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here’re some more why’s: why are why’s so triggering? why do we get defensive at a why, instead of simply answering it? why do we feel that a question about an opinion poses a threat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then a few how’s: how can we learn to become more open, more curious, and more free with our own analysis? how can we learn to share more, to learn more, to be more genuine in our selves and our opinions. how can we learn to trust  our experiences, to trust those we communicate with to not hold us to an agenda of persuasion, and to trust in the power of connecting with others to illuminate truths we could not find on our own?&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">i ask why a lot. sometimes, possibly all the times, to a fault.</summary></entry></feed>
