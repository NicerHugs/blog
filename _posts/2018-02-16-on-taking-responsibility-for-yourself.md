i've spent the last month or so thinking about the next rule and not wanting to write about it, because i've found myself repeatedly adding caveats to it; it occurs to me that the rules have a hierarchy, and that really the first rule ought to be 'Take responsibility for your own needs'.

even before that rule, tho, i've set an implicit expectation that we can know the difference between what we want and what we need. and it follows that we cannot ask for what we want if we haven't yet made that distinction, and of course our needs must come before our wants in our own self advocacy.

taking responsibility for your own needs is, well, hard. but it doesn't mean doing it all on your own. on the contrary, taking responsibility for your needs means advocating for them, and that often involves asking others to help you meet them. sometimes that means admitting you can't do something on your own, or that you don't understand something you think you should. often it means putting yourself out there, and being vulnerable. always it means knowing yourself well enough to know what you really need so that you can even begin to ask for it.

and it means, i think most importantly, when someone communicates with their words or demonstrates with their actions an inability to help you meet your needs, you do not hold them responsible for that need not being met. you can, of course, hold them responsible for failing to follow through on something if they said they would do a thing they didn't, but at the end of the day your needs are yours and yours alone. so instead of shirking your responsibility in your disappointment, you must continue to take responsibility for your own needs by finding another way for that need to be met.
