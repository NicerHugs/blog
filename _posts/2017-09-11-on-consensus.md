i am not generally ok with 'agree to disagree' because i think this assumes there are core beliefs which are unchangeable. if we ask enough questions, if we are capable of empathy, if we are committed to actually analyzing the foundations of our opinions, beliefs, experiences, why can we not actually come to a consensus?
