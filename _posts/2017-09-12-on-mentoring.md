I have heard about how the best teacher is someone who is just one step ahead of you. I think this is true of the stumble upon mentor, but not true of a professional educator. And I think promoting this idea does us a disservice by implying that mentorship is not itself a skill that can be learned, improved upon, and honed over time. With growth mindset, learning to teach is just as important as learning to learn. Those of us who find we forget what we know, or how to communicate with folks at significantly more beginner level than ourselves should learn to see this as a growth opportunity.

Being a teacher is a nobel art.  We should all aspire to give back whatever we have been given, regardless of how far down that journey we have traveled. And this means humility. It means studying the art of teaching and respecting it as a craft of it's own. It means self reflection, and effortful self improvement. It means shouldering the burden of improving our education rather than blaming the student who doesn't understand.

It is possible that the person who is one step ahead of you may be your best mentor. But it is impossible that you will be the best mentor to those only one step behind you. It is a beautiful place to start. And it is just that. A start. You will be the best mentor to those for whom you do not give up. You will be the best mentor to those for whom you learn to teach better. You will be the best mentor to those for whom you give selflessly, humbly, and fully.
