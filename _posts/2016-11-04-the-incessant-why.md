i ask why a lot. sometimes, possibly all the times, to a fault.

why do you dislike that food? why do you like this movie? why do you like this song? why do you like singing? why do you sleep so late in the day? why do you dislike the idea of an open relationship? why do you always use a fork and knife?

(that last one is an old joke. probably no one will get it)

oh, and then there's this one: why am i always asking why? i notice a pattern in the questions: they are almost always about behavior or opinions that other people just seem to be comfortable taking for granted. 	sometimes there is an interesting story, an early traumatic experience with mayonnaise, for example, that comes out with a why about a dislike. and questions about opinions are fairly common - to clarify or gather more details about a preference, for example, is common as small and big talk; but typically once an opinion is expressed, the why's begin to fall away. for the most part, it's as if we assume that the root of opinion is some core fact, some deep infallible truth, never to be questioned, and never to be discussed.

i don't really buy into that approach. you prefer blonde hair? i want to know: **why**.

am i just curious? maybe. but i also entertain the possibility that the why i'm asking is about more than just curiosity. i think i probably have an agenda.

that's not to make myself out to be a manipulator. but even innocent curiosity is an agenda on some level. i want to understand something, or at least understand it better. i want more information about a person or behavior. i want to know if my assumption about a behavior or opinion is correct. notice every single one of those curiosity inspired thoughts start with the same two words: **i want**. i want more information. i want to understand. and those wants usually go one level deeper. i want to understand _because_ i don't feel the same way. i want more information _because_ i like or dislike the person or behavior being discussed. i want verify my assumption _because..._ well, because i know i made an assumption, and i want to know if i was right.

all those wants are agendas. all those because's point to a desired outcome. innocent tho my questions may feel to me, at their core lies a self serving human who wants to know and understand and master the domain of human experience. i am asking because i want something.

and right now, i want to point this out: wanting something is not the same as _needing_ it. desiring an outcome is not the same as striving for it. i think it's fine for me to ask why, even when that why is driven by a desire for an outcome, provided that outcome isn't that i'm some egomaniac who wants to persuade everyone else to see what i see, the way i see it. really, i would be just as ok with being persuaded out of my (formed or forming) opinion or assumptions. and most of the time, it isn't actually about persuading or being persuaded at all.

what i want the most is to _understand_. my experience is small. i am confined by the tangible boundaries of my body, and the intangible boundaries of my mind. the less i agree, the more i will ask why, but it isn't that i want to change an opinion, it's that i genuinely don't understand, and i want to.

here're some more why's: why are why's so triggering? why do we get defensive at a why, instead of simply answering it? why do we feel that a question about an opinion poses a threat?

and then a few how's: how can we learn to become more open, more curious, and more free with our own analysis? how can we learn to share more, to learn more, to be more genuine in our selves and our opinions. how can we learn to trust  our experiences, to trust those we communicate with to not hold us to an agenda of persuasion, and to trust in the power of connecting with others to illuminate truths we could not find on our own?
